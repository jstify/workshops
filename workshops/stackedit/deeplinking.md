Deep Linking
------------
Deep linking is the usage of the URL, which will take to specific page (content) directly without traversing application from home page [1]. It helps in easily searchable and indexed in search engines like Google, Yahoo & etc.

**Examples for deep linking urls**:

Deep Linking in Angular
-----------------------
**With '#'**:
Angular by default supports deep linking using **'#'**.
Ex: https://www.deeplinking.com#/deep/linking

It has following drawbacks

 - Search engines (SEO) don't recognise the url after '#', so the page full path don't indexed.
 - Google analytics also don't  capture the url after '#', so we may not get results as we want.
 - Readability will decrease


**Removing '#'**: 
 We have to do following to get out of '#' in url.
 
1. **Enable html5Mode**: We have to enable this in application config file.
> $locationProvider.html5Mode(true).hashPrefix('!');

	Some browsers don't support html5Mode, for that we need to add hashPrefix('!').

2. **Loading files**: Generally in header we include files as follows
> `<script src="vendor/angular.js"></script>` 

	After enabling html5Mode, files may not load correctly. To fix this we have to set
    > `<base `**`href="/"`**` />`
	or
    `<script `**`src="/vendor/angular.js"`**`></script>`

	**Note**: If you mention href value as **'/'**, it will refer to server url. If you want to point to other domain path, which can set to href (Ex: In localhost it will not work with **'/'**, so we need to mention it as `<base href="http://localhost/appFolder/" />`

3.  **Enabling Redirection**: Reload & Refresh will not work after **html5Mode** is enabled, because browser will check for folders and it leads to `404 Not Found`. To get it worked we need to redirect to `index.html` file, we have to add following in `.htaccess` file (or in sever configuration)[2]:

	>     RewriteEngine on
	>     
	>     # Don't rewrite files or directories
	>     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
	>     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
	>     RewriteRule ^ - [L]
	>      
	>      # Rewrite everything else to index.html to allow html5 state links
	>     RewriteRule ^ index.html [L]

	**Note**: If you are using `debug.html` for development and `index.html` for production, then you have to redirect to debug.html instead of index.html for development purpose.

4. You need to remove **'#'s** before urls if you use any. We use it when we use  $routeProvider as follows:
> `<a href="#deep/linking">Deep Linking</a>`
